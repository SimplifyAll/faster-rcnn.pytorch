Use git clone to clone the folder into your project dir (anywhere) . In this case, it should be git clone https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git.

Use terminal to enter the directory, or open a terminal inside the directory (in PythonAPI) and run make. If you use a conda env in this project. Run make after activating the env.

MOST IMPORTANT (at least for me), copy or move the pycocotools folder to the root dir of the project

wherever you want to use pycocotools, import it by using e.g. from pycocotools.cocoeval import COCOeval. DON'T use from cocoapi.PythonAPI.pycocotools.cocoeval import COCOeval

faster-rcnn.pytorch/lib$ rm -rf pycocotools/
faster-rcnn.pytorch/lib$ mv <PATH_TO_FRESH_GIT_CLONE>/cocoapi/PythonAPI/pycocotools .
